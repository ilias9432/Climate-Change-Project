How Climate Change would Affect Different Countries in Europe? 

Climate Change Benefit/Loss Dashboard is powered by a Unsupervised Machine Learning Model to identify who benefit/loss by Climate Change Effects!

MODEL APPROACH

Hypothesis: the most valunareble countries should have 

High Temperature Increase 
High Precipitation Increase 
High Temperature Anomaly 
Largest Single Day Rainfall Anomaly
High Drought 
High Heat Wave 
High Coast Length 
High Increase Sea Level 
Low Average Elevation


Based on the hypothesis Unsupervised Machine Learning Model was developed to identify benefit/vulnarable countries. 

The Model uses a K-Means Clustering Algorithm and Traditional Analytical Techniques.

The model produces 2 clusters (Loss Countries, Benefit or Less Loss Countries) ranked by vulnerabilities of the countries.
